# Bank Loan Analysis 
---
## Project Overview

This project delves into a detailed analysis of bank loan data, utilizing SQL for data querying and manipulation, followed by visualization and further analysis in Power BI, Excel, and Tableau. The primary goal is to uncover insights related to loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower demographics. The analysis spans various dimensions, including temporal (month, term), geographical (state), and categorical aspects (purpose, home ownership).

---

## Objectives

- Provide a holistic view of the bank's loan portfolio performance.
- Identify trends and patterns in loan applications, approval rates, and repayment statuses.
- Assess financial health through KPIs such as Total Funded Amount, Average Interest Rate, and Loan Status.
- Facilitate strategic decision-making for the bank's credit and loan offerings.
  
---

## Data Source

The project is based on a comprehensive [dataset](https://github.com/virajbhutada/Bank-Loan-Analysis-SQL-PowerBI-Excel-Tableau/blob/main/data/financial_loan.csv) stored in SQL Server, encompassing various aspects of bank loans, including loan amounts, issue dates, interest rates, DTI ratios, and loan statuses.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Ingestion and Database Creation**: 
    - A relational database was created in Microsoft SQL Server to store the loan data.
2. **Data Analysis and SQL Queries**: 
    - SQL queries were crafted to extract key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total and monthly loan applications, funded amounts, and average interest rates.
3. **Data Processing in Excel**:
    - The dataset was further cleaned, processed, and analyzed using Excel for preliminary insights and data validation.
4. **Categorization of Loans**: 
    - Loans were categorized as 'Good' or 'Bad' based on repayment status.
5. **Temporal and Categorical Analysis**: 
    - Analysis was performed based on issue month, state, loan term, employee length, loan purpose, and home ownership.
6. **Visualization**: 
    - Outputs from SQL queries were visualized using Power BI, Excel, and Tableau to ensure data consistency and provide a graphical representation of the findings.

- **Total Funded Amount vs. Amounts Received**: Insights into the bank's liquidity and loan performance.
- **Average Interest Rate and DTI (Debt to Income) Ratio**: Analysis to understand the financial health of the borrowers.
- **Loan Categorization**: Segmentation of loans into 'Good' and 'Bad' categories, providing a clear picture of the loan portfolio's risk profile.
- **Detailed Breakdowns**: Analysis by loan status, purpose, state, term, and other factors to identify patterns and trends.
